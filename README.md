## Setting Up MkDocs
Click on the following link to help get the environment started on your computer:
https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation.

Once you have installed the necessary packages and fully setup the environment, you can build and deploy the repository to a branch.

## Deploying "Site" Contents

The documentation site that you just built only uses static files so you'll be able to host it from pretty much anywhere. Upload the contents of the entire `\site` directory after you have built the site to wherever you're setting as your local repository. Specific instructions will be posted soon.

## Modifying CSS
You can customize the css/theme.css file to change the look of the site. It is recommended for the purposes of Pinta Pals, to change the navigation heading color. This helps to make the color pop out instead of the current grey color that dulls the look of the navigation.

We do this by replacing __#9b9b9b__ to __#2980B9__ for the Read the Docs blue theme.
To replace, hold `CTRL` + `F` to look for __#9b9b9b__ within the code.
